# Delayformer: spatiotemporal transformation for predicting high-dimensional dynamics
**Delayformer** is designed to predict the dynamics of all variables simultaneously by introducing a novel **multivariate spatiotemporal information (mvSTI)** transformation. 
This transformation converts each observed variable into a delay-embedded state (vector) and facilitates cross-learning of these states across different variables. 
From the perspective of dynamical systems, Delayformer focuses on predicting **system states** rather than individual variables. This approach effectively addresses challenges related to nonlinearity and cross-variable interactions, both theoretically and computationally.
